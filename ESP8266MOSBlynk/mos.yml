# Custom configuration entries, settable via "device configuration"
# Below is a custom firmware configuration example.
# Uncomment and modify according to your needs:

config_schema:
  - ["i2c.enable", true]
  - ["sys.atca.enable", true]
  - ["blynk.enable", "b", true, { title: "Blynk enable" }]
  - ["blynk.server", "s", "blynk.e3b0c442.io:8080", { title: "Blynk server" }]
  - [
      "blynk.auth",
      "s",
      "2b2ff7ceb5dc4d48b13dcc7d1b6fc2fb",
      { title: "Blynk auth token" },
    ]
#  - ["my_app", "o", {title: "My app custom settings"}]
#  - ["my_app.bool_value", "b", false, {title: "Some boolean value"}]
#  - ["my_app.string_value", "s", "", {title: "Some string value"}]
#  - ["my_app.int_value", "i", 123, {title: "Some integer value"}]

# These settings get compiled into the C structure, and can be accessed
# from the C code this way:
#
# printf("Hello from %s!\n", mgos_sys_config_get_device_id());
#
# Settings are cool: can be modified remotely without full firmware upgrade!
#
# To see all available compiled settings, buid the firmware and open
# build/gen/mgos_config.h file.
#
# Also, in this config_schema section, you can override existing
# settings that has been created by other libraries. For example, debug log
# level is 2 by default. For this firmware we can override it to 3:
#
# config_schema:
#  - ["debug.level", 3]
